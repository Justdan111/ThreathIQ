# ThreatIQ

ThreatIQ is a community-driven security intelligence platform that helps communities detect, understand, and respond to security threats in real time. It combines trusted human reporting, location intelligence, and AI-powered risk analysis to transform fragmented information into clear, actionable intelligence.

## Why ThreatIQ

Many communities—especially in regions where formal reporting systems are limited—receive security information through informal channels (messaging apps, social media, or word of mouth). That information is often late, fragmented, or unverifiable, which leads to slower responses and increased risk.

ThreatIQ creates a central, trusted channel for reporting and verifying incidents so people and responders can act faster and more confidently.

## What ThreatIQ Provides

- Real-time incident reporting and alerts (location-aware)
- AI-assisted risk scoring and duplicate detection
- Human verification by community leaders and admins
- Interactive maps, timelines, and analytics
- Role-based access and secure reporting

## How It Works

1. Report: Users submit incidents (suspicious activity, theft, violence, infrastructure damage, emergencies) with location, description, severity, and optional media.
2. Analyze: AI checks for duplicates, assigns a risk score, and surfaces patterns across time and place.
3. Verify: Trusted community leaders and admins confirm or flag reports to improve accuracy.
4. Act: Users receive location-based alerts and can view incidents on interactive maps and dashboards.
